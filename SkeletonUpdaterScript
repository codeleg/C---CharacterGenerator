Dynamic Skeleton Part Definitions: It automatically scans child objects and determines skeleton parts dynamically.
Warning for Missing Settings: If the config is missing, it gives an error.
More Modular and Readable: Each function does a clear task.
Automatic Update: Automatically updates using OnValidate when you make changes in the Unity Editor.

SkeletonUpdater Script: README

Overview

The SkeletonUpdater script is a Unity component designed to dynamically manage and update the skeleton parts of a character in a scene. It allows for the easy configuration of limb sizes, hand positions, spine adjustments, and overall Y-positioning using a ScriptableObject-based configuration system. This ensures flexibility, reusability, and ease of maintenance.

Key Benefits

Dynamic Skeleton Management: The script automatically identifies and organizes skeleton parts based on child transforms, eliminating the need for manual assignments.

Config-Driven Customization: Changes can be made through a CharacterConfig ScriptableObject, enabling artists and designers to tweak skeleton parameters without modifying the script.

Real-Time Updates: Adjustments are immediately visible in the Unity Editor using the OnValidate method, enhancing productivity.

Error Handling: Provides clear warnings and error messages for missing configurations or unrecognized skeleton parts.

Design Patterns Used

1. ScriptableObject Pattern

The use of CharacterConfig as a ScriptableObject separates configuration data from runtime logic. This pattern offers:

Reusability across multiple characters.

Improved workflow for non-programmers.

Reduced coupling between the configuration and the script.

2. Dictionary-Based Lookup

Skeleton parts are stored in a Dictionary for efficient lookups. This approach ensures:

O(1) access time for updates.

Easy extensibility to accommodate additional skeleton parts.

3. Fail-Safe Mechanisms

The script uses conditional checks and logging to handle potential misconfigurations, making it robust and user-friendly.

Variable and Method Explanations

Public Variables

config: Holds the reference to the CharacterConfig ScriptableObject, which contains all the skeleton parameters.

skeletonParts: A dictionary mapping skeleton part names to their corresponding Transform objects.

Key Methods

InitializeSkeletonParts: Automatically populates the skeletonParts dictionary based on child transforms.

UpdateSkeleton: The main method to apply the configuration values to the skeleton parts.

UpdateLimbSize: Adjusts the size of a specific skeleton part.

UpdatePosition: Updates the local position of a skeleton part.

UpdateYPosition: Changes the root object's vertical position.

OnValidate: Ensures real-time updates when properties are modified in the Unity Editor.

How to Use

Setup Configuration:

Create a new CharacterConfig via Assets > Create > Configs > Character.

Define values for armSize, handSize, handPosition, spineSize, and yPosition.

Attach the Script:

Add the SkeletonUpdater script to the character's GameObject.

Assign Configuration:

Drag the CharacterConfig asset to the config field in the Inspector.

Update Skeleton:

Call the UpdateSkeleton method programmatically or modify values in the Inspector to see real-time changes.

Error Handling

If the config is null, the script logs an error and skips updates.

If a skeleton part is not found in the dictionary, a warning is logged, ensuring no silent failures.

Customization and Extensibility

To add new skeleton parts or behaviors:

Update the CharacterConfig class to include additional properties.

Modify the UpdateSkeleton method to handle the new parts.

This modular design ensures that the script can easily adapt to new requirements without significant rewrites.

Future Enhancements

Animation Integration: Add support for dynamically adjusting skeleton configurations based on animation states.

UI Controls: Provide an in-game UI for runtime customization.

Validation Tools: Enhance OnValidate to detect and auto-correct common issues, like missing child transforms.

Conclusion

The SkeletonUpdater script is a robust, extensible, and user-friendly solution for managing character skeletons in Unity. By leveraging modern design patterns and best practices, it ensures high performance and maintainability, catering to the needs of both developers and designers.

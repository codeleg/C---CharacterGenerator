# CharacterGenerator 
Modules and a professional approach for Character Generator in games

Why the First Script (FirstGenerator) Works for You
Simplicity:

The CharacterGenerator script is straightforward, with clear and explicit variable assignments for each body part.
It directly manipulates Transform objects and applies size/position changes without relying on external data structures or configurations.

Direct Manipulation:

Since everything is declared and managed within the script, it feels self-contained.
Changes happen immediately upon modifying values in the Unity Inspector or script.

Immediate Feedback:

The use of OnValidate() ensures that any adjustments in the editor reflect in real-time, making it easier to see the results.
Why the Second Script Might Be Challenging

Separation of Concerns:

The SkeletonUpdater script delegates its configuration to a ScriptableObject (CharacterConfig), which might feel like an unnecessary abstraction if you're not familiar with this design pattern.
You need to create and assign a CharacterConfig instance for the script to work, adding an extra step compared to directly modifying variables.

Dynamic Structure:

It dynamically retrieves and stores skeleton parts using a Dictionary, which assumes the hierarchy and naming in your scene are well-organized and consistent.
If any part of the expected setup is missing (e.g., a child with a specific name), the script might not work as intended, leading to runtime warnings.

Complexity:

This script is more robust and flexible, designed for reusable configurations and dynamic updates.
However, this complexity can make it harder to understand and use if you're unfamiliar with concepts like ScriptableObject or dictionary-based management.

Key Differences in Design
Feature	CharacterGenerator	SkeletonUpdater
Configuration	Inline in the script	Delegated to ScriptableObject
Flexibility	Hardcoded structure	Dynamic, reusable for multiple setups
Scalability	Limited to current script	Easier to extend for multiple characters
Error Handling	Minimal	Warns if parts are missing
Best Suited For	Simple, single-use character setups	Complex, reusable character systems

Combine the Approaches:

You could integrate aspects of both scripts:
Use a ScriptableObject for flexible configurations.
Maintain direct manipulation for simplicity.
